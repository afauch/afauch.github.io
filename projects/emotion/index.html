				<h2>How does it feel when an app responds to your emotions?</h2>

				<p>A pioneer in the affective computing space had built a biometrics product that could react to a user’s feelings. The company’s CEO approached me to help them build an app in 4 days to help demonstrate the promise of an emotionally-aware future for our digital lives.</p>

				<h3>Framing the Vision</h3>
				<p>Hitting the ground running, I worked with the team to think backwards towards what they most hoped to demonstrate in their VR demo. Showing the technical capacity of their product was important; however, the experience their product could provide was centered on emotion, so the demo's primary purpose was to elicit spontaneous emotion.</p>

				<figcaption>The night they gave me the brief, I led the team through a 3-hour ideation session to encourage broad, generative thinking about the domain of emotional connection.</figcaption>

				<h2>We stripped away distracting details, letting emotion emerge as the lifeblood of the experience.</h2>

				<p>I quickly realized that the client’s beta prototypes faced a difficult problem: the more detail they added to make the prototype feel ‘realistic,’ the further they distanced the user from feeling real emotion (and the closer they creeped towards the uncanny valley). However, after conducting comparative research, I realized that cartoons are excellent at communicating the essence of emotion while avoiding this problem. Ultimately, I guided the team towards a prototype strategy that was less focused on realism while retaining essential features that could communicate the range of emotion.</p>

				<figcaption>As creative director for the project, I worked closely with the 3D artist to breathe life into the range of emotions detected by the client’s product.</figcaption>
	
				<h2>No one had used an interface like this before. How can we scaffold the user’s first experience with emotion-based interaction?</h2>
				<h3>Staging & Sound</h3>
				<p>I used staging and sound to better communicate the essence of the experience. The arrangement of the characters and the initial suspenseful created a comical sense of anticipation as the user first signed in. This was meant to elicit a smile, to which the characters would then react with giggles and joy. I contracted a sound designer to help further tailor the mood and character reactions. The user was eased into an understanding that their own emotions would cause the characters and environment to react in real-time.</p>

				<figcaption>Level design, music design, and sound effects were absolutely critical to bringing the user into a state of immersion.</figcaption>

				<h2>I directed a 3-person team from concept to functional demo in 5 days.</h2>
				<p>As project lead, I served as interaction designer, creative director, and Unity developer. I contracted a 3D artist and sound designer to support production. I was responsible for translating the demo’s business requirements, passed on by the CEO, into creative direction for the demo team, ensuring that aesthetic and art style conveyed a fun yet trustworthy tone. I also worked closely with the project’s machine learning engineer to translate sensor feeds into functional application inputs.</p>

				<h2>After the sprint, I built additional VR experiences to demonstrate technical aspects of the client’s product.</h2>
				<p>Much of this task involved communicating certain functional metrics to engineers, but in a VR environment.</p>
