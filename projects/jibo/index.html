				<h2>Can bots help us become better people?</h2>
				<p>The folks behind Jibo think so. As part of a design challenge, I designed Compliments as a prototype application meant to help people give and receive compliments using the Jibo robot.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="context.jpg" />
				</figure>

				<p>Jibo is a social robot who lives in your home. I was tasked with designing a skill in which Jibo facilitates creating and delivering  compliments in a charming manner. Not only did the app have to fit intuitively into users' lives - it had to fit Jibo's personality as well.</p>

				<h2>I focused my exploratory research on Jibo's target segments: early adopter types and young families.</h2>
				<p>I conducted over 60 minutes of phone interviews with 3 research subjects: an early-adopter couple from Massachusetts, and the father in a young family from Madison, Wisconsin. I used an exploratory research plan to guide my questions towards understanding the human needs, motivations, and pain points on the topic of compliments.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="interviews.png" />
				</figure>

				<h2>How is a compliment best delivered to make someone feel good about themselves? Look to the movies.</h2>
				<p>Jibo's personality exudes not only through what he says, but how he says it, through cadence, body language and semi-speech audio (SSA). With some help from YouTube, I studied the choreography of successful (and awkward!) compliments in films, to learn about how these nonverbal cues contribute to the execution of a compliment that gets the desired end result: making the receiver, and giver, feel good about themselves.</p>

				<p>My initial research helped me discover a few key insights to guide the design of Jibo's Compliments skill.</p>

				<h3>Task modeling.</h3>
				<p>The exchange of a compliment is much more than a simple statement. Actually, it's a complex and fascinating dance of observation, communication, and emotion that can occur over several interactions. Compliments always include a giver and receiver, and tend to follow a particular conversational sequence between the two. I distilled my research on this exchange into a task model that would help give Jibo's Compliment skill an intuitive rhythm. Conversational roles alternate between active and passive, as shown by the highlighted path at left.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="task-model.png" />
				</figure>

				<h3>Developing design principles.</h3>
				<p>Using the <a href="https://experiencinginformation.com/2014/08/12/ux-strategy-blueprint" target="_blank">UX Strategy Blueprint</a> as a tool, I translated research insights into more actionable guiding principles for the design of the Compliments skill, as well as a set of How Might We? prompts to spur ideation.</p>

				<img src="design-principles.png" />


				<h3>Storyboarding.</h3>
				<p>My ideation process began with a set of quick pen-and-paper storyboards that followed a user through a possible sequence of interactions. This first pass helped me identify possible snags and challenges that would require more planning and ideation. For example - should users be able to receive compliments via their phone if they're not at home? Or, how should the system leverage the existing contacts architecture?</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="storyboard-1.png" />
				</figure>

				<h3>Going broad.</h3>
				<p>In the next phase of brainstorming, I picked apart each segment of the task model, brainstorming each stage. I generated concepts about how Jibo should initiate a new compliment, assist in its composition, delivered to a recipient, and reciprocated. I considered metaphors like trophies, fortune cookies, and badges, but eventually decided that a system of timed, pre-composed voice messages best fit the design principles developed previously.</p>

				<h3>Validating needs with low-fi prototypes.</h3>				
				<p>In the next phase of brainstorming, I picked apart each segment of the task model, brainstorming each stage. I generated concepts about how Jibo should initiate a new compliment, assist in its composition, delivered to a recipient, and reciprocated. I considered metaphors like trophies, fortune cookies, and badges, but eventually decided that a system of timed, pre-composed voice messages best fit the design principles developed previously.</p>

				<figure>

				<h2>Despite the simplicity of the prototype, I quickly learned important lessons: users needed time to compose a compliment for their loved one, and users became uncomfortable if Jibo 'knew too much' about them.</h2>

				<h3>Wireframing and user flows.</h3>
				<p>'Wireframing' an animated, speaking robot isn't like wireframing a mobile app. To better refine the multimodal aspects of the interaction, I developed a wireframing template that allowed me to communicate the different components of Jibo's expression, such as his words, GUI, body posture, semi-speech audio, and LED set. I also used flow diagrams to further define interaction states for the next user test.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="wireframes.png" />
				</figure>

				<h2>User testing a conversational, multimodal robot interaction (without incurring expensive development costs) requires some creativity.</h2>
				<p>I determined that a Keynote prototype, illustrating Jibo's body language, key GUI elements, and sounds, would be the most efficient for gathering insights at the next level of the concept. I used Ableton Live to generate sounds for Jibo, and grabbed icons from the Noun Project to 'wireframe' Jibo's GUI iconography. My second user test involved controlling Jibo's states through a Keynote remote, while the user interacted with the simulated Jibo onscreen.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="prototype-2.png" />
				</figure>

				
				<p>Working across Illustrator and Photoshop, I based my UI design on the Jibo's in-house iconography and GUI kit. I curated a set of icons from the Noun Project, and modified them to fit the visual character of Jibo's other system icons.</p>

				<h2>The final Compliments skill included three features that addressed core user needs.</h2>

				<h3>Features</h3>
				<p><em>Assisted composition</em> includes vocal prompts that comfortably guide the user towards compliments that are genuine. With <em>thoughtful expression</em>, Jibo’s compliments relay the message when the receiver is comfortable, to avoid making them feel self-conscious and allowing the receiver to relish the compliment. They appear like the message on a fortune cookie - slightly surprising, pleasingly affirming, but requiring no response. <em>Timed delivery</em> means that Jibo's words of affirmation can be there when you can't be, by drawing from your pre-composed bank of compliments when your loved ones need them the most.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="features.png" />
				</figure>	
				
				<h3>Mobile Delivery</h3>
				<p>I also mocked up a mobile delivery option, to depict a roadmap feature that would allow Jibo owners to receive compliments outside the home.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="mobile.png" />
				</figure>				

				<h3>Illustrating the Interaction</h3>
				<p>Using Maya and AfterEffects, I generated a high-fidelity mockup of Jibo's movement, SSA, and delivery of a compliment.</p>
